# Z80 Micro System RC2014
A Z80 small system based on the RC2014

At the beginning of 2024 I decided to dust off books from 40 years ago and remember great experiences with the Z80. I realized that I had forgotten many things about the wonderful Z80.
I reread some books like 'Microprocessadores e Microcomputadores Hardware e Software - Tocci and Laskowski' and 'Programando o Z80 - Ney Acir de Oliveira and André Gil Rubens', I had the great pleasure of having André as my teacher in the 80s.
I tried several circuits posted on the internet, finally I came across the great project that is RC2014 (https://rc2014.co.uk) and also SCMON (Small Computer Monitor - www.scc.me.uk). As I was looking for something simpler, I made some changes that resulted in my project. I hope you like it.
As I wanted to do something without having to buy many components (the only ones I bought were the MC68B50P and the 7.3228MHz crystal), I used an EPROM, an EEPROM can be used with small changes. I used the R0000009.BIN image downloaded from the official RC2014 website, on the board there is a jumper where you can select SCMON or MS Basic.
If you find any error in this text, I'm sorry, english is not my native language.
